## Assumptions
- the assumption has been made that white space is defined as a singular space
- the instruction input can be taken in both upper case or lower case


## Next Steps
- the program would be extended to take multiple robot inputs at once and processed sequentially
- no LOST again

## Test instructions

delete node modules
package json

testRunner.html

test
run test with LOST
