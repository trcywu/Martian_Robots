## Assumptions
- the assumption has been made that white space is defined as a singular space
- the instruction input can be taken in both upper case or lower case


## Next Steps
- currently the output given the known parameters will always print LOST. This is a known error, and if given more time i would  create an array with the history of robot coordinates that have returned LOST so that new outputs can be checked against them
- the program would be extended to take multiple robot inputs at once and processed sequentially
- no LOST again
