# Martian Robots

## Introduction

This is a code challenge completed in vanilla JavaScript and testing with Jasmine.

## Run instructions

To run application:
open ```robots.html``` in browser.

To run tests:
open```testRunner.html``` in a browser.

## Assumptions
- white space is defined as a singular space
- the instruction input can be taken in both upper case or lower case

## Next Steps
- Add in form input validations
- LOST coordinates currently do not leave a 'scent'. Next step is to create a robot history array to push in previous LOST coordinates. This is to be checked against every robot output which determines whether LOST needs to be printed again for the same coordinate
- The program currently only takes a single set of Robot input. The next step would extend the program to take multiple robot inputs at once and processed sequentially
