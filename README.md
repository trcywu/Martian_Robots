# Martian Robots

## Introduction

This is a code challenge completed in vanilla JavaScript and testing with Jasmine.

## Run instructions

To run the jasmine unit tests,

To run application:
open ```robots.html``` in browser.

To run tests:
open```testRunner.html``` in a browser.

## Assumptions
- the assumption has been made that white space is defined as a singular space
- the instruction input can be taken in both upper case or lower case

## Next Steps
- currently the output given the known parameters will always print LOST. This is a known error, and if given more time i would  create an array with the history of robot coordinates that have returned LOST so that new outputs can be checked against them
- the program would be extended to take multiple robot inputs at once and processed sequentially
